/// Store that contains the application state, the reducer logic, the middleware and the listeners
///
/// The store contains four components:
/// - **state**: represents the application state. This state is partitioned into state keys. Each key can represents a full application screen, flow, or view controller.
/// - **reducer** represents the logic to update the state. A reducer mainly provides a function that updates the state for a paticular action.
/// - **middleware**: an object (or list of objects) that intercept an action and can enrich or alter it before finally dispatching it to the reducer.
/// - **listener**: a function that gets called when a state is changed.

  ///   - type: The type of the state to listen to. If the state type is not found, the listener will not be notified.
  ///   - stateKey: (Optional) the state key to listen to. When not passed (or passing nil) the type name from `forStateType` will be used.
  ///     Only pass when the state key for the state was changed in the reducer (99% of the times you dont need to set this parameter)
