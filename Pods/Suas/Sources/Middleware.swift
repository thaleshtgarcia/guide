/// Middleware protocol that represents a suas store middleware
/// A middleware helps extending the dispatch logic of Suas.
///
/// A middleware can be used to implement:
/// - Logging that logs the state before and after the reducer changes it
/// - Perform async network calls and dispatches actions representing the result when the network returns.
/// - Other advanced usages...
///
/// # Example
///
/// Implementing a logging middleware.
///
/// ```
/// class LoggerMiddleware: Middleware {
///   var api: MiddlewareAPI?
///   var next: DispatchFunction?
///
///   func onAction(action: Action, getState: @escaping GetStateFunction, dispatch: @escaping DispatchFunction, next: @escaping NextFunction) {
///     // Read the state before any reducer changes it
///     print("The old state is \(getState())")
///
///     // Print the action
///     print("The action is \(action)")
///
///     // Continue the dispatching process..until the reducer reduces the action
///     // Not calling `next` will prevent the action from reaching the reducer
///     next?(action)
///
///     // Read the state after any reducer changes it
///     print("The new state is \(api?.state)")
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
public protocol Middleware {
  /// Function called when an action is dispatched
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  /// - Parameter action: the dispatched action
  ///   - getState: a function that can be used to read the current Store state
  ///   - dispatch: a function that can be used to dispatch new actions to the Store
  ///   - next: function that represents the continuation of the dispatching process. The middleware can do the following with it:
  ///     - If it calls `next` the execution will proceed and the action will eventually reach the reducer
  ///     - If it does not call, then the action is said to be handled by the current middleware.
  ///     - Middleware cancall `next` with a new action, this action is used instead of the original one.
