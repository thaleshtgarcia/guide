[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-105410314-2/github/suas-ios?pixel)](https://github.com/zendesk/Suas-iOS)

Suas is a [unidirectional data flow architecture](https://suas.readme.io/docs/why-unidirectional-architectures) implementation for iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS and Android heavily inspired by [Redux](http://redux.js.org). It provides an easy-to-use library that helps to create applications that are consistent, deterministic, and scalable.

Suas focuses on providing [good developer experience](#developer-experience-and-tooling) and tooling such as [customizable logging](#customizable-logging) and [state changes monitoring](#state-changes-monitoring).

# Suas application flow and components

Suas architecture is composed of five core elements:

  * [Store](https://suas.readme.io/docs/store): main component that contains a [Reducer](https://suas.readme.io/docs/reducer) (or [set of reducers](https://suas.readme.io/docs/applications-with-multiple-decoupled-states)), and the main application [State](https://suas.readme.io/docs/state). [Listeners](https://suas.readme.io/docs/listener) subscribe to it for state changes. [Actions](https://suas.readme.io/docs/action) that cause state changes are dispatched to it.
  * [State](https://suas.readme.io/docs/state): defines the state of a component/screen or group of components/screens.
  * [Action](https://suas.readme.io/docs/action): each action specifies a change we want to effect on the state. 
  * [Reducer](https://suas.readme.io/docs/reducer): contains the logic to alter the state based on a specific action received.
  * [Listener](https://suas.readme.io/docs/listener): callback that gets notified when the state changes.

The following animation describes the Suas runtime flow.

# Why use Suas 
Suas helps you to build highly-dynamic, consistent mobile applications:

- Cross platform; Suas-iOS works on iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. [Suas-Android](https://github.com/zendesk/Suas-Android) works on all API levels and provides a Kotlin-friendly interface. 
- Focuses on [developer experience](#developer-experience-and-tooling) with plugins/tools like [LoggerMiddleware](https://suas.readme.io/docs/logging-in-suas) and [Suas Monitor](https://suas.readme.io/docs/monitor-middleware-monitor-js).
- Small code base with low operational footprint. Check the source code ðŸ™‚.
- Static typing and type information are conserved in the Store, Reducers, and Listeners.
- Fast out of the box, and can be customized by developers to be even faster [with filtering listeners](https://suas.readme.io/docs/filtering-listeners).

# Installation

Suas on the iOS can be installed with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

## Installing with Carthage

Open your `Cartfile` and append the following:

```
github "zendesk/suas-ios"
```

And then build it with `carthage update --platform ...`

## Installing with CocoaPod

Add `pod 'Suas'` to your `Podfile`.

```
use_frameworks!

source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'Suas'
```

Then run `pod install`

# Getting started

Let's get started by building a counter application. 

When building applications in Suas, we start by defining the state for our counter. In this example, the counter state is a struct that contains the counter value.

```swift
struct Counter {
  var value: Int
}
```

We then define the actions that affect the state. For the counter, we need increment and decrement actions.

```swift
struct IncrementAction: Action {
  let incrementValue: Int
}

struct DecrementAction: Action {
  let decrementValue: Int
}
```

Now that we have both the `State` and the `Actions`, we need to specify how actions are going to affect the state. This logic is implemented in the reducer. The counter state reducer looks like the following:

```swift
struct CounterReducer: Reducer {

  var initialState = Counter(value: 0)

  func reduce(state: CounterReducer.StateType, action: Action) -> CounterReducer.StateType? {
    // Handle each action
    if let action = action as? IncrementAction {
      var newState = state
      newState.value += action.incrementValue
      return newState
    }

    if let action = action as? DecrementAction {
      var newState = state
      newState.value -= action.decrementValue
      return newState
    }

    // Important: If action does not affec the state, return ni
    return nil
  }

}
```

The reducer defines two things:

1. The initial state for the store. i.e. the initial `Counter` value.
2. The reduce function, which receives both the dispatched `Action` and the current `State`. This function decides what `State` to return based on the `Action`. If the reducer did not change the state, it should return `nil`

The `Store` is the main component we interact with in the application. The store contains:

1. The application's state.
2. The reducer, or reducers.
3. (Advanced) The [middlewares](https://suas.readme.io/docs/middleware)

We create a store with the following snippet:

```swift
let store = Suas.createStore(reducer: counterReducer)
```

Now we can dispatch actions to it and add listeners to it. Let's look at our UI.

```swift
class CounterViewController: UIViewController {
  @IBOutlet weak var counterValue: UILabel!

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Finally: Use the store
    
    self.counterValue.text = "\(store.state.value(forKeyOfType: Counter.self)!.value)"
    
    // Add a listener to the store
    // Notice the [weak self] so we dont leak listeners
    let subscription = store.addListener(forStateType: Counter.self)  { [weak self] state in
      self?.counterValue.text = "\(state.value)"
    }

    // When this object is deallocated, the listener will be removed
    // Alternatively, you have to delete it by hand `subscription.removeListener()`
    subscription.linkLifeCycleTo(object: self)
  }

  @IBAction func incrementTapped(_ sender: Any) {
    // Dispatch actions to the store
    store.dispatch(action: IncrementAction(incrementValue: 1))
  }

  @IBAction func decrementTapped(_ sender: Any) {
    // Dispatch actions to the store
    store.dispatch(action: DecrementAction(decrementValue: 1))
  }
}
```

Let's break down the code above:
1. We add a listener to the store by calling `store.addListener(forStateType: Counter.self)` specifying the state type. 
Notice that we **Must** use `[weak self]` reference in the callback block to prevent strong memory cycles.
2. By calling `subscription.linkLifeCycleTo(object: self)` we link the listener lifecycle to the view controller. When the controller is deallocated the listener is removed.
3. Tapping on the increase or decrease button dispatches actions with `store.dispatch(action:)` that change the state.

# Developer experience and tooling

Suas focuses on developer experience and tooling. It provides two plugins in the form of [Middlewares](https://suas.readme.io/docs/middleware) out of the box.

## Customizable logging
While the `LoggerMiddleware` logs all the action received with the state changes.

<p align="center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yFRGNXe.gif" title="source: imgur.com" />
</p>

Read more about [how to use the LoggerMiddleware](https://suas.readme.io/docs/logging-in-suas).

## State transition monitoring

The `MonitorMiddleware` helps to track state transition and action dispatch history.
When using `MonitorMiddleware` the `Action` dispatched and `State` changes are sent to our [Suas Monitor desktop application](https://github.com/zendesk/Suas-Monitor).

<p align="center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QsbDsN7.gif" title="source: imgur.com" />
</p>

Read how to install and start using the `MonitorMiddleware` by heading to [getting started with monitor middleware article](https://suas.readme.io/docs/monitor-middleware-monitor-js).
Under the hood `Suas Monitor` uses the fantastic [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) to provide state and action information.
